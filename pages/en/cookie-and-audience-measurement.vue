        Audience measurement
      </h2>
      <p>
        Like most sites and applications, Oblyk uses a tool to measure its audience, such as the number of pages viewed, the most popular pages, the number of visitors, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is an essential tool for identifying problems and areas for improvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use Matomo, hosted by FELINN, to measure the Oblyk audience.
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4">
        <li><a href="https://matomo.org/" target="_blank">Matomo</a> is an audience measurement tool that respects privacy and has been validated by the CNIL as a <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-et-autres-traceurs/regles/cookies-solutions-pour-les-outils-de-mesure-daudience" target="_blank">legitimate measurement tool</a> for collecting data that is only necessary for the proper functioning of a site or application..</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.felinn.org/" target="_blank">FELINN</a> is an association based in Lyon that campaigns for net neutrality and respect for privacy on the Internet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Matomo is configured in such a way that all data collected (such as IP addresses) is anonymised. This means that we only have a global view of Oblyk usage and cannot trace it back to a specific user.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have activated the "Do not track me" option on your browser, Matomo does not collect your browsing data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the anonymous and purely functional nature of the navigation data that matomo collects, you can refuse that Matomo collects it by selecting the option below:
      </p>
      <div class="border rounded px-4">
        <matomo-consent />
